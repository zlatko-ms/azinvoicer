# azinvoicer

Parses Azure invoice csv fila and determines an (optimized) baseline.

The tool expects the output to be compliant with the descrption from the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/understand-usage).

However as different column namong schemas can be found from the field, the tool will try to guess the correct mapping. If this does not succeed, you can override the model.
